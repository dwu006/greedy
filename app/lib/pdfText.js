    COMPUTER SCIENCE 33: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER ORGANIZATION
    UCLA Department of Computer Science
    Spring 2025 Syllabus
    
    INSTRUCTOR: Dr. Samuel Johnson
    Email: samuel.johnson@ucla.edu
    Office Hours: Monday/Wednesday 2:00-3:30pm, Boelter Hall 3256
    
    TEACHING ASSISTANTS:
    Jane Smith (jane.smith@ucla.edu) - Lab Section 1A
    Michael Wong (michael.wong@ucla.edu) - Lab Section 1B
    
    COURSE DESCRIPTION:
    This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer organization and architecture. Topics include number representations, assembly language programming, processor design, memory hierarchies, virtual memory, and input/output systems. Through hands-on laboratory assignments, students will gain practical experience with low-level programming and understanding how hardware and software interact.
