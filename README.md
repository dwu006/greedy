# Greedy

![Greedy Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Greedy-Education%20Platform-forestgreen?style=for-the-badge)

## Why "Greedy"?

This platform is named after the greedy algorithm paradigm in computer science - a problem-solving approach that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the aim of finding a global optimum. Just as greedy algorithms provide elegant solutions to complex problems through simple decision-making rules, our platform aims to streamline the educational experience with straightforward yet powerful tools.

In education, the "greedy" approach means giving students and instructors the most immediate, optimal path to their goals: teaching effectively and learning efficiently. At each step of the educational journey, we provide the best available option, creating an optimal overall experience.

## Inspiration

Greedy was born from the observation that existing educational management systems often:

1. Overwhelm users with complexity
2. Lack visual context for assignment timelines
3. Don't provide intuitive progress tracking
4. Make collaboration between instructors and students unnecessarily complicated

We set out to create a platform that addresses these issues with a visually engaging, intuitive interface that puts assignments and learning progress front and center.
